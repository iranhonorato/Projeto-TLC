These studies, however, neglect the question of whether persistent high-growth firms exhibit distinct growth patterns. To analyze this question empirically, we examine a database of approximately 16,000 persistently high-growth companies located in Brazil during the period 2013–2016. First, we develop a clustering analysis, finding three high-growth patterns. Based on this classification, and through ordered logit regression, we then examine whether regional dimensions explain the differences in growth. The results indicate that companies located in regions with more availability of technological, educational, and physical infrastructure are more likely to be in the groups with the highest growth. On the other hand, the increase in regional sophistication in economic terms tends to reduce the likelihood of very high growth. This specific result is confirmed when we perform quantile regressions. 1 INTRODUCTION Research on high-growth firms (HGFs) has gained increasing prominence in the debate on entrepreneurship and economic development (Coad et al., 2014 ; Holzl, 2014 ). One of the main reasons is that HGFs play a relevant role not only in job creation (Acs & Mueller, 2007 ; Birch & Medoff, 1994 ; Brüderl & Preisendörfer, 2000 ; Davidsson & Henrekson, 2002 ; Henrekson & Johansson, 2010 ; Littunen & Tohmo, 2003 ) but also in economic growth (Bos & Stam, 2014 ; Davidsson & Henrekson, 2002 ; Wong et al., 2005 ). Among the different lines of research, some authors have devoted special attention to persistent HGFs as opposed to companies with only one or a few high-growth episodes (Bianchini & Pellegrino, 2019 ; Chen & Song, 2020 ; Dosi et al., 2019 ; Erhardt, 2021 ; Moschella et al., 2019 ). The interest on this topic stems from the fact that persistent HGFs are the most promising candidates to contribute substantially to sustainable job creation (Bianchini & Pellegrino, 2019 ) and economic expansion (Moschella et al., 2019 ). The main research question within this literature is to what extent firms are able to sustain their high growth rates over time and whether there are firm-level determinants of this behavior. However, while it is clear that persistent HGFs can be different from other companies in terms of growth rates and firm-level determinants, it is less clear how they may differ from each other. Because HGFs typically represent a small fraction of all firms in a given region or industry (Bottazzi & Secchi, 2006 ), the literature has tended to assume that they are homogeneous—even more so for persistent HGFs. Although some authors have shed light on the potential heterogeneity of persistent HGFs (Bianchini et al., 2017 ; Dosi et al., 2019 ), we still know very little about this phenomenon. Thus, there is a gap in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to present novel evidence on the heterogeneity of persistent HGFs. In contrast to the received knowledge, we restrict the analysis to a sample containing only persistent HGFs and, within this group, analyze the regional determinants of different growth rates. First, we identify the different patterns of persistent high growth. Specifically, we analyze the universe of Brazilian companies (4.1 million firms) and identify those that present high persistent growth in terms of the number of employees during the period 2013–2016. This generates a set of approximately 16,000 HGFs, which can be divided into three distinct groups through cluster analysis (Delmar et al., 2003 ; McMahon, 2001 ). Then, we examine the regional characteristics that may explain the differences in the growth patterns of persistent HGFs in Brazil. We estimate an ordered logit regression using the clusters as a dependent variable and the characteristics of the regions of Brazil as explanatory variables. The results indicate that companies located in regions with more availability of technological, educational, and physical infrastructure are more likely to be in the groups with the highest growth. On the other hand, the increase in regional sophistication in economic terms tends to reduce the likelihood of very high growth. This specific result is confirmed when we perform quantile regressions. As a whole, this article brings new elements to the debate around the characterization and determinants of persistent high growth. Our study also expands the discussion about the distinct patterns of firms' growth processes (Coad et al., 2017 ) and complements the discussion about the particularities of HGFs and the possible differences between HGFs and non-HGFs (Barbero et al., 2011 ; Barringer et al., 2005 ; Colombelli et al., 2014 ; Lopez-Garcia & Puente, 2012 ; Moreno & Casillas, 2007 ). The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the received knowledge. In section 3, we describe the context of analysis, the formation of our sample, and the main variables. Section 4 presents the cluster analysis and section 5 proceeds with the empirical model to test the impact of regional characteristics on different groups of high-growth companies. In section 6, we complement our analysis with a quantile regression. Finally, in section 7, we summarize the main findings and discuss the limitations of our study and its implications. 2 BACKGROUND This section presents the related literature and describes the roots of this paper. 2.1 Persistence of high growth Persistent firm growth has attracted increasing attention from researchers, although it is still a controversial topic (Erhardt, 2021 ; Moschella et al., 2019 ). From an empirical perspective, Erhardt ( 2021 ) notes that evidence on persistent growth is inconclusive and dependent on the choice of growth measure. While some authors find additional growth after a period of high growth (Du & Temouri, 2015 ; Holzl, 2014 ; Satterthwaite & Hamilton, 2017 ; Senderovitz et al., 2016 ), others find growth decline (Capasso et al., 2014 ; Coad, 2007 ; Coad & Hölzl, 2009 ; Daunfeldt & Halvarsson, 2015 ). Still, others note that episodes of high growth are rarely repeated (Daunfeldt et al., 2014 ; Dillen et al., 2014 ; Esteve-Pérez et al., 2021 ; Gabrielsson et al., 2014 ; Léon, 2020 ; Moschella et al., 2019 ). From a theoretical point of view, persistence in growth would challenge Gibrat's law—according to which corporate growth can be described as a stochastic process—and, more generally, would go against the idea of luck as a determinant of growth (Bianchini & Pellegrino, 2019 ). This is relevant in that it creates space for strategic action—for example due to the presence of superior resources (Barney, 1991 ; Peteraf, 1993 )—as well as for public policies (Hart et al., 2021 ) to promote growth and employment. To put it another way, the non-randomness of persistent growth is a necessary condition for building meaningful public policies and strategies. In this article, we are interested in not only verifying the occurrence of persistent growth but also its potential heterogeneity. 2.2 Heterogeneity among HGFs There are not many studies analyzing the heterogeneity among HGFs. Delmar et al. ( 2003 ) investigate the different ways in which companies can achieve high growth. The authors identify seven different types of high-growth patterns depending on the growth measure used. Their classification ranges from “super absolute growers” and “steady sales growers” to “erratic one-shot growers.” Hence, one of their main conclusions is that not all high-growth companies grow the same way. In a similar vein, Bianchini et al. ( 2017 ) observe that HGFs may present different growth trajectories. In a group of HGFs, we can find from “one-hit wonders”—i.e., companies that show high growth in the first year and then remain stable without growing more (Daunfeldt & Halvarsson, 2015 )—to companies with persistent high growth. Despite these differences, Bianchini et al. ( 2017 ) find no evidence that economic and financial characteristics of HGFs and persistent HGFs from a range of European countries differ systematically. Persistent high-growth companies are neither productively different nor profitably different and show no difference in financial conditions compared to high-growth companies. Moschella et al. ( 2019 ) find similar evidence for the Chinese manufacturing sector. While these findings are important and open up new research possibilities, the variety of persistent HGFs still needs to be better understood. We know very little about the diversity of companies within the group of persistent HGFs. 2.3 Regional determinants Considering the potential existence of different patterns of persistent high growth, a question arises as to whether the company's location influences its growth (Audretsch, 2012 ; Audretsch et al., 2015 ; Cantner et al., 2021 ; Kalafsky & Rice, 2017 ; Mason et al., 2015 ; Vaessen & Keeble, 1995 ). Indeed, there has been an emerging body of research studying the geographic factors that influence HGFs (Duschl et al., 2015 ; Motoyama, 2014 ; Stam, 2005 ). Li et al. ( 2016 ), for example, find evidence that, in the US, local conditions that favor HGFs are different from those that favor new companies in general, and that these conditions differ in urban and rural areas and by industrial sectors. For the EU, Sleuwaegen and Ramboer ( 2020 ) show that the allocation of human capital in creative occupations has the greatest impact on the occurrence of HGFs in a given region. They also find evidence that agglomeration economies and the quality of market support institutions and infrastructure positively influence the prevalence of HGFs. Looking at the UK between 1997 and 2013, Du and Vanino ( 2021 ) find evidence of positive spillovers from HGFs in the labor productivity of non-HGFs in the same sector and region. However, the externalities regarding employment growth in non-HGFs are negative, suggesting effects of labor poaching and local competition. More generally, several studies have brought evidence that reinforces the importance of regional or sectorial factors for the growth of companies (Audretsch & Dohse, 2007 ; Lechner & Dowling, 2003 ). Capozza et al. ( 2018 ), for example, find evidence that both localization economies and diversification economies influence the emergence of innovative start-ups in Italy. Fischer et al. ( 2018 ) show that in the most developed region of Brazil, knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship is concentrated in and around some specific urban areas due to agglomeration economies. Schölin et al. ( 2017 ) find evidence that about 10% of the total variation in entrepreneurship in Sweden can be attributed to the municipality and region level. Analyses of industrial districts in the city of Amsterdam and in Germany also suggest a positive relationship between business growth and geographic location. Growth is enhanced by the diversity of complementary activities and locally available knowledge (skilled and diversified labor), as well as proximity to modern transport infrastructure (Audretsch & Dohse, 2007 ; Barbosa & Eiriz, 2011 ; de Vor & de Groot, 2010 ). To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the influence of regional characteristics on persistent high growth. 3 IDENTIFICATION FRAMEWORK AND MAIN VARIABLES In this section, we describe the methodological steps we used to form our sample, as well as the main variables. 3.1 Context and sample We developed our analysis using Brazilian data. In Brazil, as in most countries, HGFs are responsible for generating the majority of new jobs. According to the latest available official data, HGFs accounted for approximately 30,000 companies in the country by 2016 (0.75% of the total), although the people employed by them increased by 172% between 2014 and 2016, reaching 2.7 million. In Brazil, most HGFs are small companies, with an average age of 14 years (IBGE, 2018 ). Since we did not have access to the microdata of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics—IBGE (i.e., the official “Bureau of Census”), we sought help from a big data company to form our sample. 1 This brought both positive consequences and limitations to the analysis. We examined the universe of active companies in the country (4.1 million firms), identifying those that were characterized as high growth and adding their different characteristics, such as region and sector of activity. However, we had no access to the age of the firms nor their financial characteristics. 2 3.2 Identification of persistent HGFs To identify persistent HGFs, we started with the Eurostat-OECD definition, which describes HGFs as companies with at least 10 employees that grow by at least 20% per year for three or more consecutive years in number of employees or revenue (Eurostat-OECD, 2007 ). We chose it because it is a composite formula for measuring growth, thus reducing the influence of absolute and relative formulas on company size (Erhardt, 2021 ). The definition by Eurostat-OECD has been commonly used for the analysis of persistent HGFs (Dillen et al., 2014 ; Du & Temouri, 2015 ; Gabrielsson et al., 2014 ; Holzl, 2014 ; Satterthwaite & Hamilton, 2017 ). The data were initially analyzed for the period 2009–2012. This made it possible to identify an initial group of HGFs. The growth of this group was then tracked for the next four years. In our database, we have only maintained the companies that presented at least 20% growth per year between 2013 and 2016, i.e., those companies that according to the Eurostat-OECD definition have shown continuous high growth in the period. Applying this criterion, it was possible to identify 16,142 persistent HGFs distributed across the 5 regions of Brazil. Due to a restriction on data collection, we chose the number of employees as our only reference variable (i.e., growth indicator). We did not have access to the companies' sales and revenue data because this information is available exclusively to the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service. It is worth noting, however, that the number of employees can be a relevant measure and other authors also used it to measure persistent growth (Acs, 2011 ; Coad, 2007 ; Daunfeldt et al., 2014 ; Dillen et al., 2014 ; Du & Temouri, 2015 ; Gabrielsson et al., 2014 ; Moschella et al., 2019 ; Senderovitz et al., 2016 ), some of whom used only this growth indicator in their studies (Capasso et al., 2014 ; Coad & Hölzl, 2009 ; Daunfeldt & Halvarsson, 2015 ; Holzl, 2014 ; Satterthwaite & Hamilton, 2017 ). 3.3 Regional characteristics Brazil is made up of 27 states (including the Federal District), which are divided into five regions. The regions differ greatly in terms of their socio-economic development levels. The north and northeast regions, for example, are poorer and less developed compared to their counterparts in the south and southeast. Table 1 shows the average values of the variables that we use in our estimations. We looked for variables that represent potential demand and purchasing power of the local population, such as household income and GDP per capita; economic development indicators such as the human development index (HDI) and the level of education of the population; and variables of availability of resources for production, such as credit and R&D investments. We also included two variables (energy consumption and transport infrastructure), which capture resource endowments (i.e., restrictions) at the regional/state level. Although Table 1 presents an overview of the variables by region, we use data by state in our regressions. 3 Variable Region Southeast South Midwest Northeast North Household income per capita (R$) 1,728.0 1,595.5 1,455.7 763.6 988.3 GDP per capita (R$) 41,544.6 30,702.0 29,238.1 10,425.0 22,575.5 Unemployment rate 7.5% 4.2% 4.3% 6.1% 7.5% Human development index (HDI) 0.78 0.75 0.73 0.64 0.67 Regional participation in national GDP 32.2% 6.1% 1.7% 1.3% 1.5% Percentage of people with 10 years or more of education 50.7% 44.0% 40.4% 29.8% 41.5% Corporate credit operations (R$ millions) 591,427 110,539 32,660 15,084 15,146 Default rate of corporate credit operations 2.1% 2.4% 2.3% 2.8% 2.8% Spending on R&D (R$ millions)—public and private 11,110.6 738 40 50.4 105.7 Energy consumption (in MWh) 5.1 × 10 7 4.6 × 10 7 4.5 × 10 7 4.2 × 10 7 3.9 × 10 7 Transport infrastructure (road network paved by 1,000 km 2 ) 0.023 0.015 0.012 0.013 0.006 Sources : IBGE, Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), Brazilian Central Bank, Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation, and Communications. 3.4 Control variables We used controls related to the characteristics of the companies. Specifically, we analyzed their size as well as the type of tax regime in which the company fits and its compliance with tax obligations. The companies were also categorized by their industry. For the size of the companies, we followed the OECD classification, which divides the companies into four categories according to the number of employees. Microenterprises have fewer than 10 employees (and thus are not considered in our sample). Small businesses have 10 to 49 employees. Medium-sized companies have 50 to 249 employees. Finally, large companies employ 250 or more people. The tax regime is an important aspect in the analysis of the Brazilian business environment. This is because Brazil has a business tax reduction and simplification scheme targeted for micro and small businesses, the so-called SIMPLES regime. The use of SIMPLES is optional, although it is widespread among companies (de Paula & Scheinkman, 2010 ; Fajnzylber et al., 2011 ; Monteiro & Assunção, 2012 ). We controlled for this regime because it might generate a potential incentive for the company not to grow—or grow more slowly—due to the confusing tax environment in Brazil. Companies may choose to be smaller with the deliberate intention of staying within a simpler tax range. Another important aspect of the Brazilian business environment is the informality of firms (Monteiro & Assunção, 2012 ). Shadow businesses can have an advantage over firms that meet all legal and tax obligations, and this can influence their growth. In order to control for this effect, we introduced a dummy variable “good tax health,” which indicates the company's compliance with taxes and other tax obligations. This variable is calculated from statistical modeling that considers the following factors for each company in our sample: hiring and dismissing of employees, number of registered employees, changes in the corporate structure, any change in the company's register with the Federal Revenue Service, and frequency of payment of taxes. A fast-growing company with no indication of changes in these factors is more likely to operate in the shadows (i.e., without registering its employees). Finally, it is worth mentioning that during the analyzed period, Brazil suffered a severe recession that may have affected the regions and industrial sectors differently, thus potentially biasing the results. To control for this potential effect, we have included in the analysis the productivity by state and the added value by sector of economic activity. 4 CLUSTER ANALYSIS Our first question concerns the existence of different patterns of persistent high growth, which represents the heterogeneity of the companies in our sample. The identification of different patterns of persistent growth was performed using the annual number of employees from 2013 to 2016 in a cluster analysis based on the k-medians method , which uses the median as the statistic to determine the center of each cluster (i.e., group). The use of the median as the center of the groups is a more appropriate choice in comparison with the mean since our sample has many extreme values of growth (Dalatu, 2016 ). The Euclidian distance was used as a measure of dissimilarity and the decision of the number of groups was based on the Calinski/Harabasz pseudo- F , a measure calculated by the ratio between the sum of squares between groups and the sum of squares within the groups. The intention is to segregate the sample into groups that are internally homogeneous and, at the same time, heterogeneous among themselves, in a descriptive but non-subjective way. Formally, the k -medians method can be expressed as where, given a set of x data points, the K centers are to be chosen so as to minimize the sum of the distances ( S ) from each x to the nearest (i.e., median of group ). 4.1 Cluster analysis results Table 2 shows the Calinski/Harabasz pseudo- F values. The highest value indicates the formation of three clusters. This means that the choice of 3 groups maximizes the heterogeneity between the groups (i.e., it maximizes the homogeneity within the groups), thus indicating that this would be the optimal choice of the partitioning method. Number of clusters Calinski/Harabasz pseudo- F 2 2,024 3 2,415 4 2,309 5 1,896 6 1,667 7 1,526 Accordingly, three statistically distinct groups were identified. Their evolution from 2013 to 2016 in terms of the number of employees is presented in Table 3 and in Figure 1 . The statistical comparison between the average growth of the groups was performed through analysis of variance (ANOVA), with multiple comparisons between groups using the Bonferroni method. The results indicate that the groups differ in each of the evaluated years (see Table 3 ). It is important to remember that all the companies in the sample are considered to be high growth and have had at least 20% growth in each year. Group Number of companies Average number of employees Variation 2013 2014 2015 2016 2016–2013 G1 10,121 44.33 59.86 76.40 90.09 105.87% G2 4,927 36.77 79.39 106.99 112.15 210.27% G3 1,094 31.20 208.21 294.93 316.96 929.67% ANOVA F 8* 190* 215* 207* 3,665* Note ANOVA F statistics and statistical significance (* p < .01). The groups are different 2 by 2 using the Bonferroni method. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Median number of employees by group Group 1 is formed by 10,121 companies, which present average growth of 106%; this group is the one with the lowest growth compared to the others. Group 2 is formed by 4,927 companies whose average growth is 210%. Group 3 comprises 1,094 firms that are “high achievers”: they are characterized by an impressive 930% growth for the period. In 2016, the three groups together generated approximately 1.8 million jobs, while the total stock of formal jobs in the country fell by 2 million compared to the previous year (IBGE, 2018 ). Group 3 accounted for 19% of this total, although it represented only 7% of the firms analyzed. This fact only reinforces that the companies in Group 3 grow in a much more notable way compared to the other firms in our sample. Even more importantly, the existence of three distinct groups means that persistent high growth does not appear to be a homogeneous phenomenon. In other words, the evidence points to the existence of different patterns of high persistent growth, which can be described in an orderly fashion. Table 4 presents the main characteristics of the groups. The firms are evenly distributed within the five regions of Brazil. Group 1 accounts for approximately 60% of the HGFs in each region. Group 2 accounts for about a third of the companies identified, and Group 3 accounts for approximately 7% of the HGFs. There is also uniformity in the distribution of firms between regions. Almost 50% of the companies in each group are located in the southeast region of the country. The south region, meanwhile, contains 20% of the Group 1 companies, 16% of Group 2 companies, and 12% of Group 3 companies. Another important region is the Northeast, with 17% of Group 1 companies, 19.5% of Group 2, and 21% of Group 3. Variable Total Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Region Southeast 7,785 4,863 2,375 546 (100%) (62.47%) (30.51%) (7.01%) South 3,014 2,045 829 139 (100%) (67.87%) (27.51%) (4.61%) Midwest 1,475 924 444 107 (100%) (62.64%) (30.10%) (7.25%) Northeast 2,984 1,792 963 228 (100%) (60.07%) (32.28%) (7.64%) North 887 497 316 74 (100%) (56.03%) (35.63%) (8.34%) Size Small 13,864 8,701 4,213 950 (100%) (62.76%) (30.39%) (6.85%) Medium 1,957 1,192 630 135 (100%) (60.91%) (32.19%) (6.90%) Large 321 228 84 9 (100%) (71.03%) (26.17%) (2.80%) SIMPLES 5,394 3,897 1,386 111 (100%) (72.25%) (25.70%) (2.06%) Good tax health 14,307 8,961 4,377 967 (100%) (62.63%) (30.60%) (6.80%) In our sample, most companies are small. There are 13,864 small companies that represent 85.9% of the total. Of these, 62.8% are in Group 1, 30.4% in Group 2, and 6.8% in Group 3. A little more than a third of our sample (5,394 companies, or 33.4% of the total) operates under the SIMPLES tax regime. Analyzing each group separately, we can see that 38.5% of Group 1 companies and 28% of Group 2 operate under SIMPLES, but only 10% of Group 3 companies are in this tax regime. The majority of companies in each group show good tax health. In other words, persistent HGFs, in general, are up to date with their obligations to the Treasury. Finally, the majority of companies (21%) belong to the manufacturing industry segment, and the composition among the groups varies little. Exceptions are the construction sector where Group 2 represents 42.7% of the companies, and the administrative activities sector where Group 3 represents 11.4% of the companies. 5 ORDERED LOGIT ESTIMATION Once we have identified the existence of three distinct groups of persistent HGFs, we use the ordered logit regression model (McCullagh, 1980 ) to assess the effect of regional characteristics on the probability of persistent high growth. This model is suitable since the response variable corresponds to cluster analysis groups, as described in the previous section. The groups can be ordered naturally, from the lowest high growth to the highest high growth; however, the distances between adjacent groups are not known. Formally, let be a latent and continuous variable, defined as the persistent high growth of company i . We can write the regression model, where is the vector of explanatory variables of the i th company and is the random error. Since we do not observe directly, we define as the observed dependent variable, which takes the form of a discrete indicator, where to are unknown values that separate the high-growth groups. The probability of belonging to each group is modeled as a function of the vector of explanatory variables, that is, where and F is the logistic cumulative density function. The vector includes both the regional dimensions (measured at the state level) and the characteristics of the companies. We use one-year lagged explanatory variables to model the causal effect of regional-level variables on firm growth, as we expect that a variation in these regional factors at a given time would cause changes in future firm growth . 5.1 Ordered logit regression results Table 5 presents the results of the order logit estimation. We used robust standard errors estimated via Bootstrap and clustered by state and industry. The model was considered statistically relevant based on the Wald statistic. In addition, the estimated model can be considered satisfactory, with at least 20% of the variability of the groups explained by the variables. We also incorporated the variation in the number of employees into the model to control for the difference in terms of growth between groups.

Asterisks denote significance levels: * p < .10 ** p < .05 *** p < .01. We present two models. Due to data restriction, the variables “value added by sector” and “productivity by state” greatly reduce our sample. However, since these variables were not significant, we chose to present an estimate without them (model 1) and with them (model 2). Note that the results do not change between models. We can see that the region influences persistent high-growth dynamics, since regional explanatory variables (including state dummies) are relevant. The results show that companies located in states with higher R&D spending and where the population is more educated are more likely to be in the highest growth groups. The same is true of energy consumption and transportation infrastructure. There is evidence, therefore, that the highest persistent high growth is associated with the availability of technological, educational, and physical infrastructure. Regarding R&D spending, there is a discussion about different types of innovation in the literature, and our econometric results need to be considered in this context. For instance, while Hölz and Friesenbichler ( 2008 ) find that product innovation has a positive effect on employment growth, Coad and Rao ( 2008 ) and Hall et al. ( 2008 ) find that process innovation leads to employment decline (see also Bianchini & Pellegrino, 2019 ). Although it is true that Daunfeldt et al. ( 2016 ) find that HGFs are less frequent in sectors with high levels of R&D investment, this might be simply a competition effect, as R&D investment in these sectors is higher than in others. Yet one should not lose sight that we are analyzing the regional aspects and not sectoral aspects. Thus, what our estimate indicates is that spending on R&D has an effect on the probability of higher persistent high growth, suggesting a regional dynamic, for example, through spillovers (Glaeser et al., 2015 ; Greenstone et al., 2010 ). Regarding education, the results indicate a positive and high effect, which sheds light on the relevance of human capital over the highest persistent high growth (Klette & Kortum, 2004 ; Rossi-Hansberg & Wright, 2007 ). Indeed, we can argue about the existence of a dynamic of interdependence, whereby human capital and R&D are strategic complements and both influence growth (Redding, 1996 ). On the other hand, companies located in states with a higher HDI, higher percentage of participation in national GDP, as well as a higher volume of corporate credit operations, are less likely to be in the highest growth groups. This result may be associated with the economic sophistication of a region, which generates a greater level of competition between companies (Porter, 1990 ). For example, the higher volume of corporate credit operations indicates that more companies are seeking to finance their growth. This tends to raise regional GDP while creating competitive pressure among firms. The existence of many competitors can encourage companies to improve their processes and products, pursue new technologies and revise their strategies—the result being a more sophisticated productive sector that can trigger better living conditions and a higher HDI. However, if there are many competitors in the market, the likelihood that innovations and improvements are imitated increases, which can naturally reduce the growth rate of companies (Sjöholm, 1999 ). There is evidence, for instance, that access to credit is considered important to explaining the growth of companies, but it is not a significant determinant of the rapid or extreme growth of the number of employees (Lopez-Garcia & Puente, 2012 ). More generally, therefore, increased competition makes it more difficult to increase persistent high growth. Finally, we can analyze the dummy variables that indicate the geographic states. They contain information from other regional factors that were not considered among the model variables. The northeast and north states present a statistically lower probability of owning companies in the higher-growth groups compared to the southeast states. As previously noted, the north and northeast states are the least developed in comparison to the other states of Brazil (Azzoni, 2001 ; Baer, 1964 ). The north region contains a large part of the Amazon Forest, which is characterized by difficult access and predominantly extractive and rural activities. The northeast region, on the other hand, is characterized by recurrent droughts, which hampers basic development insofar as financial resources tend to be channeled into short-term relief measures (Baer, 1964 ). Among the specific characteristics of firms, we find evidence that companies with good tax health, with greater variation in the number of employees between 2013 and 2016 and of smaller size, are more likely to belong to the higher-growth groups. In combination, these elements suggest a virtuous circle in which the company's past growth (which enables it to meet tax obligations, hire more employees, and thus grow in size) stimulates its present high growth. This indicates that past growth episodes increase the likelihood of current rapid growth (Lopez-Garcia & Puente, 2012 ). 6 QUANTILE REGRESSION The structure of our database also invites us to analyze the issue of persistent high growth from another perspective. Instead of analyzing the groups, we can ask how the regional variables and the characteristics of the firms influence their growth variation, measured in quantiles. This analysis is a complement to, and not a substitute for, our previous analysis. The quantile regression model (QRM) is used to properly address differences in the relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent response variable (Koenker & Bassett, 1978 ; Koenker & Hallock, 2001 ). Koenker and Bassett ( 1978 ) introduced the conditional quantile in the regression model equation, assuming that the θ th quantile of the conditional distribution of Y (growth variation in this paper) is linear in X (matrix of explanatory variables). The conditional quantile can be represented as where denotes the θ th quantile of the conditional distribution of growth variation, conditional on x i ; c θ is the vector of unknown parameters to be estimated for each value of θ in ; is the error term; and is the cumulative distribution function, conditional on x . The estimator, c θ , is obtained using linear programming techniques by solving, with the loss function δ θ defined as 6.1 Quantile regression results Table 6 presents the results of the regression models estimated for the growth variation of firms. Model 1 is a usual multiple linear regression, while the other models correspond to the quantile regression estimated for the following quantiles: 10% (Q10), 30% (Q30), 50% (Q50), 70% (Q70), and 90% (Q90). As we can see in the table, there are different impacts of the analyzed factors on growth, depending on the growth percentile. Furthermore, the goodness of fit of the QRMs is reasonable.

In the regression, the unemployment rate negatively influences the growth of companies located between the 30% and 90% quantiles, with a significance level of 10%. That is, the higher the unemployment rate, the lower the growth. This result is not surprising, since our dependent variable is measured in terms of job variation. The interesting results are those related to the variables HDI and state participation in national GDP. They are both negatively associated with the firm's growth, especially for those in the highest percentiles (Q50 to Q90). The higher the company's growth, the greater the magnitude of the marginal effect of HDI on growth—which indicates that companies with higher growth are more negatively influenced by HDI than companies with “lower” growth. On the other hand, the higher the company's growth, the greater the marginal effect of regional participation in GDP. Taken as a whole, these results bring more light to the results of the previous section. Regional factors do not seem to influence the growth of firms that show “less intense growth” (that is, those located in the lowest quantiles). However, HDI and the regional participation in GDP negatively influence the growth of firms located at the highest quantiles, with the marginal effect of these variables increasing as the intensity of growth increases. That is, increasing HDI and regional participation in national GDP increases the company's chance of being in a higher-growth group (as indicated in the previous section) but reduces high growth. This result suggests that the “local economic sophistication” effect (measured in terms of HDI and regional participation in GDP) does play a relevant role in the dynamics of persistent high growth. In terms of the characteristics of firms, the SIMPLES tax regime has a negative influence on the growth of companies for all percentiles. The higher the growth, the greater the negative marginal effect of the SIMPLES regime on the company's growth. As mentioned, this may be a consequence of a distorted tax system. Companies may choose to be smaller with the deliberate intention of staying within a simpler tax range. The size of the firm also negatively impacts growth in all percentiles. Medium and large companies grow less, on average, compared to small firms. And for firms located at higher percentiles, the negative impact of size on growth is more intense. 7 CONCLUDING REMARKS The persistence of high growth is a topic of interest due to its theoretical and public policy implications; however, we still need to advance in the understanding of this phenomenon (Bianchini et al., 2017 ; Moschella et al., 2019 ). This article is heading in that direction. We address the question of whether persistent high-growth companies exhibit distinct patterns of growth and whether such patterns are influenced by the region in which the company is located. To do so, we examined a database of 16,142 companies with persistent high growth located in Brazil during the period 2013–2016. We followed three steps. First, we developed a cluster analysis and found three distinct high-growth groups. Based on this classification, and through ordered logit regression, we then examined whether regional characteristics explain the differences in growth patterns. The results indicate that companies located in regions with higher spending on R&D, higher energy consumption, and better transportation infrastructure, and where the population has more education are more likely to be in the groups with the highest growth. On the other hand, a higher level of economic sophistication tends to reduce the likelihood of very high growth. In fact, as indicated by our third step (quantile regression), the increase in regional sophistication in economic terms disproportionately impacts the fastest-growing companies. One key implication of this paper is that heterogeneity among persistent HGFs could be a reason why many studies do not find any significant determinant of repeated high growth. A hypothesis to be tested is whether the persistent growth of distinct groups of firms follows the same logic (e.g., random process) or if there are differences in the key growth drivers of each group. This is a new research question: Can different persistent growth patterns be supported by different logics? To answer this question, we need more complete data for each firm (Coad & Srhoj, 2020 ). However, as already stated, one limitation of our study is the absence of variables that more accurately describe the specificities of each company. Due to the lack of data, we have not been able to analyze aspects already investigated in other studies such as age, liquidity, efficiency, and innovation of companies (Bianchini et al., 2017 ; Moschella et al., 2019 ). In addition, we could not analyze organizational characteristics, for example, top management profile and team size (Chen & Song, 2020 ). The lack of important firm-level variables can potentially affect our analysis as we do not examine individual factors (e.g., each firm's productivity) that can help explain accelerated growth. There are almost certainly more explanatory factors at play, and our research captures only part of the phenomenon. This is also an opportunity for future research. A logical step would be to investigate how regional aspects and individual characteristics of companies interact to determine the different patterns of persistent high growth. With regard to public policies, the results obtained in this article emphasize the importance of investment in both R&D and education as drivers for the highest growth of companies. This sheds light on the relevance of providing a more sophisticated technological and educational infrastructure. On the other hand, as local competition tends to reduce the likelihood of further persistent high growth, policies focused on “champions” tend to be ineffective and counterproductive (Moschella et al., 2019 ). In fact, there is evidence of a positive relationship between the dynamism of the distribution of growth rates of companies and the growth of productivity of the economy (Bravo-Biosca, 2010 , 2011 ). The competition puts pressure on companies, and this tends to increase overall productivity. Therefore, the point is not to protect the very high growth of some companies but to create the economic conditions so that more companies can enter a period of high growth. CONFLICT OF INTEREST There are no relevant financial or non-financial competing interests to report. ENDNOTES 1 The company is headquartered in Brazil, being the largest big data analytics company in Latin America. It is able to process more than 3,000 databases from 600 different sources. 2 The big data company analysed a combination of publicly accessible databases, especially data on hiring new employees, dismissals, and tax status of firms. Through specific algorithmic models, the data were filtered and refined to build the database for this study. The big data company did not have access to sensitive firm data, such as detailed tax data or full registration (including year of foundation). 3 We chose this form of presentation based only on parsimony, seeking to provide an overview of the variables.
